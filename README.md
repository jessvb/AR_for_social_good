# AR_for_social_good
Augmented reality system developed for MIT's [Office of Experiential Learning](http://oel.mit.edu/) during the Design for Social Impact Hackathon.

This system was developed using the [Unity Tool for AR.js](https://github.com/taylordigital13/ARjs_Unity) and [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js) itself.
