# AR_for_social_good
Augmented reality system developed for MIT's [Office of Experiential Learning](http://oel.mit.edu/) during the Design for Social Impact Hackathon. Also see our [presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ylcQTGUY2N27d03t7eEw-2hoE4FSVOdVcZSEVZbwUR0/edit?usp=sharing).

This system was developed using the [Unity Tool for AR.js](https://github.com/taylordigital13/ARjs_Unity) and [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js) itself.
